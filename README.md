Probabilistic Language Models

Java app that allows:

- given a corpus file, generates NGram count files;

- given a Unigram a Bigram and a parametrization file (to find out which is the more likely word) allows to test probabilities using:
	- Markov Assumption;
	- Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE);
	- Laplace smoothing (if needed);

Was developed for academic purposes for a course on Natural Language Processing
